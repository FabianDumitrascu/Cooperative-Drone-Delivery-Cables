## Project Overview

This project aims to overcome the limitations of drone payload capacities by employing a cooperative approach, where two drones work together to carry packages with cables. By harnessing the synergy between advanced drone hardware and algorithmic innovation, we seek to push the boundaries of urban aerial mobility.

## Objective

Our mission is to design, build, and implement a system enabling two quadrotor drones to collaboratively carry a rigid-body payload using cables. This entails constructing drones from the ground up, developing centralized control algorithms for waypoint tracking, and validating these algorithms' effectiveness in a controlled environment with the aid of motion capture systems.

## Technologies and Tools

- **ROS2**: Utilized for developing drone control and planning algorithms, facilitating robust and efficient system operation.
- **Gazebo**: Employs for simulating drone behaviors and interaction with the environment, crucial for testing and refining control strategies.
- **Agilicious**: A state-of-the-art flight stack, providing a solid foundation for drone control and enabling the implementation of advanced flight features.

## Main Activities

- **Drone Construction and Initial Testing**: Building two quadrotor drones equipped with the "Agilicious" flight stack, laying the groundwork for subsequent algorithm development and testing.
- **Control Algorithm Design and Simulation**: Creating centralized control algorithms to manage the cooperative flight of the drones and conducting preliminary tests in virtual environments like RViz/Gazebo.
- **Real-World Implementation and Testing**: Applying the developed control algorithms in real-world flight tests to achieve precise payload delivery and waypoint tracking, supported by motion capture technology for enhanced accuracy.
