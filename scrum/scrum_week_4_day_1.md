#### Sprint Retrospective:

- **What Went Well:** First time that we saw a bar and ropes in Gazebo. Velocity controller is as good as done.
- **What Could Be Improved:** Fabian had the feeling that he didn't know what to do exactly. Programming together doesn't work nice. 
- **Action Items:** Make a Node and find out how to use it in the PID controller.
